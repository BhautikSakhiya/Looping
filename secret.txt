Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.
We can perform file handling in Java by Java I/O API.
 OutputStream
Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.

InputStream
